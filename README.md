# DevSecOps and Governance as Code
CMPSCI:5888 Cybersecurity Capstone Project

## Overview
As the world is becoming more and more dependent on technology, and most if not, all service sectors are transforming themselves from a service mindset to a technology mindset with a service offering, Cyber Security is of ever more significance. Meanwhile, regulators are catching up with the change in Cyber Security landscape and are continuing to introduce new regulations to protect customers and consumers of technology. This has led to organizations caught in a unique situation where they are pressured to move fast and deliver product and services to the customer all the while being compliant to regulatory obligations. In order to keep pace with business demands, most leading organizations have begun to implement either an “Agile” or “Dev-Sec-Ops” model.  While this approach allows for increased agility and iterative development, it also requires thoughtful and perhaps automated governance to avoid an impedance mismatch between Agile methodology and Security Governance.  Combining this increased need to support Agile/Dev-Sec-Ops with the need to provide fast and thorough governance presents a daunting challenge for today’s IT and Security executives.

## DevSecOps Goals
This DevSecOps development aims to create a framework for a software pipeline that conforms to external regulatory compliance and secures the company’s digital assets.

## Outcome 
This project produced a comprehensive research report and executive-level presentation that describes automating Governance as Code in a Dev-Sec-Ops model. This research describes leading practices for automating governance and provides a phased approach to implementing such a practice at a large healthcare organization.
